I have a bunch of video files from 56 lectures given by Dr Lipton. Each file contains the lecture number in a format like "1 of 56" or "2 of 56" ... something like that, and I want you to write a bash script that will rename each of these files such that when I order them by name they are ordered with respect to the lecture number. I also want that the other part of the filename is kept intact, just take care that the lecture numbers are at the start of the filename in such a way that these files can be ordered by name following increasing lecture numbers. Use only 7 bit ASCII characters.


#!/bin/bash

# Script to rename video files by lecture number

# Set current directory
cd /path/to/files/

# Loop through files in the current directory
for f in *; do
  # Find the lecture number
  lecture_number=$(echo $f | grep -o -E '[0-9]+ of 56')
  
  # Get the other part of the filename
  rest_of_filename=$(echo $f | sed -e "s/$lecture_number//")
  
  # Rename the file
  mv "$f" "${lecture_number}_${rest_of_filename}"
  
done
